==========================

1. Fix Electron sandbox crash on Ubuntu 24.04

   Problem: App crashed with "zygote_host_impl_linux.cc" fatal error on Ubuntu 24.04.

   Cause: Electron sandbox requires either SUID chrome-sandbox or --no-sandbox flag.

   Solution:
   - build/linux/after-install.sh: Creates wrapper script at /usr/bin/wavespeed-desktop
     that launches binary with --no-sandbox
   - package.json: Added desktop.exec with --no-sandbox for GUI launches,
     removed AppImage target (deb only)

2. Fix libstable-diffusion.so not found

   Problem: SD binary failed with "cannot open shared object file: libstable-diffusion.so"

   Cause: Linux doesn't search the binary's directory for shared libraries by default.

   Solution:
   - electron/lib/sdGenerator.ts: Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to binary directory before
     spawning SD process

3. Build stable-diffusion.cpp with CUDA support

   Problem: Pre-built Linux binary used AVX512 CPU instructions not supported by all CPUs,
   causing "Illegal instruction" crash. No CUDA build available in releases.

   Solution: Built from source with CUDA:

     sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
     git clone --recursive https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp /tmp/sd-cpp
     cd /tmp/sd-cpp && mkdir build && cd build
     cmake .. -DSD_CUDA=ON
     cmake --build . --config Release -j18

   Installed CUDA binary to: ~/.config/wavespeed-desktop/sd-bin/

   Result: Z-Image now uses RTX 4000 Ada GPU for generation.

4. Update Z-Image GPU acceleration message

   Problem: Message said "CPU only on Linux" which is no longer accurate.

   Solution:
   - src/pages/ZImagePage.tsx: Changed key from linuxCpuOnly to linuxCudaSupported
   - src/i18n/locales/*.json (all 18 files): Renamed key and updated message to:
     "Z-Image uses GPU acceleration when available (CUDA on Linux, Metal on macOS,
     Vulkan on Windows)."
